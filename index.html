  <h1>❃HAPPY 19th BIRTHDAY🎂🎉</h1>
  <h3><li>Things may change over time, but I will remain the same. How can I forget your birthday? I wish you a happy birthday.


All the beautiful moments we share will always be fresh in my memory. No amount of joy can erase that. One thing is sure that I will not allow any one else to enter into my life except you.

You always reside in my thoughts, why my heart still believes that someday these distances between us will be reduced.

I have dedicated my whole life to live in your loving memory. May be this is my punishment for hurting the most beautiful and sincere girl of my life, Once again Happy birthday dear🌸</li></h3>
